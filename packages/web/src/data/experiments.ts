      'Make the ISC cost model concrete and turn its “illustrative” constants into something you can probe. Validates R* = (N·c_c + W·c_m)/(c_q − c_r): the reads after which compiling once (ISC) beats re-deriving meaning on every query (QSR).',

      'No external data — a parametric model. The calculator computes total cost for QSR and ISC across cumulative reads R for any constants. For a measured study, plug in real c_c/c_m/c_q/c_r from running real QSR and ISC pipelines on a corpus.',

    evaluation:
      'Per-update wall-clock (full re-SVD O(nd²) vs. incremental). Subspace agreement via maximum principal angle. Retrieval quality via recall@10 vs. the full-recompute neighbours. For the virtual axis update, an orthogonal Procrustes map from a small anchor set, scored by mean cosine to truly re-embedded vectors vs. fraction re-embedded.',
